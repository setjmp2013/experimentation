# experimentation
- testing out a list with a few other things.
- And *test* is italic.
- while **more** is bold. But can ***bold/italic***?
- More about R can be found at [R Project][2].
- [R Bloggers][1] is a handy resource.

First Paragraph here is going to run into the *next* one.
Second Paragraph is running into the first. Will **fix** that for the next one though.

Third Paragraph Line is ***clean*** I hope.
